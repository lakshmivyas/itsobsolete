                <strong>WTF?</strong>
                <p>
                    If we were living in a world that was fair, IE6 would be dead. Not just dead, it would have been executed. Alas, the world is not fair and the only dead things are billions of nerve cells that belong to the brains of thousands of web designers and developers.

                    <a href="/">This website</a> is a "better-late-than-never" condemnation of the lack of justice in this unfair world of web development. This website was originally developed as a message for the IE6 users that visited <a href="www.ringce.com">Ringce</a>

                <strong>Thanks for the history lesson. Seriously, WTF?</strong>
                <p>
                    Hey! I wanted a page that would convey a message to IE6 users(that IE6 is not supported) when they visited my site. It would be displayed once during the visit. The page will link back to my website if they still wanted to visit anyway. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>I like it, can I also use this as my condemnation?</strong>
                <p>
                    Sure. I mean, <strong>fucking yeah!</strong> That is the purpose of <a href="/">this website</a>. You can download the script and copy paste the html include from <a href="http://gist.github.com/53220">here</a>.

            <li>
                <strong>I like it, but I can be lot more clever and funny.</strong>
                <p>
                    The entire source for this website is available <a href="http://github.com/lakshmivyas/itsobsolete">here</a>. You can fork the repository and share your cleverness and sense of humor. If people agree with your statement above, it will find its way here.

                <strong>How would you know if people like my version better than yours?</strong>
                <p>
                    Based on the number of people that watch your fork, and notable mentions in the blogosphere.
                </p>

                <strong>What if some people like A and others like B?</strong>
                <p>
                    Every fork that is included will have its own url.
